                                    <b>My 21st Century Class Experience&#128214;</b>
                                    <br><br>
                                    Studying 21st Century Literature with my class and my teacher was an exciting and enriching journey. Throughout the semester, I learned so much about literature, both from the Philippines and around the world. The lessons, activities, and group projects made the class engaging and fun.&#x1F499;
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Third Quarter: Exploring Filipino Literature &#x1F58B;</b>
                                    <br><br>
                                    In the third quarter, the lessons were about 21st century literature of the Philippines. I learned about its history and different periods, from pre-colonial times to contemporary literature. I also discovered the contributions of famous Filipino writers, including Dr. José Rizal. Learning about these authors made me appreciate their impact on our country’s culture and identity.
                                    One of the most remarkable for me was reading and analyzing Gabu, a poem by Carlos Angeles. The poem gave me a deeper understanding of the beauty and power of Filipino literature, and through the painting &#x1F3A8; my partner and I made, we are able to bring into life our own interpretation of the poem.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We also had several engaging activities, such as acting, roleplays, and my favorite was dressing up in Filipiniana attire to encourage the audience to appreciate Filipino literature. Every activity was done with a partner, making the experience more enjoyable and memorable because
                                    it allowed us to have a diversity of ideas and our goal in each activity was to intertwine these ideas in a way that is creative and overall, the best.&#x1F493;
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Fourth Quarter: Exploring World Literature&#x1F30D;</b>
                                    <br><br>
                                    In the fourth quarter, the topics were about  21st century literature from around the world. Aside from this, my group discussed for the class how ICT skills are applied in literature. We studied different adaptation formats, such as museum, loose, and transformative adaptations. Our class was divided into groups, which made learning more interactive and competitive. Each group had to strategize and work together to earn points, making the lessons exciting.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the best parts of this quarter was our reporting activity, where each group created a review game. The review games created by each group has a different creative twist, making learning educational, competitive, and fun.&#x1F603;
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>A Special Thanks&#x1F469;&#x200D;&#x1F3EB;</b>
                                    <br><br>
                                    As the school year comes to an end, I would like to express my gratitude to my teacher, Mrs. Joycelyn Sy. Thank you for making our 21st Century Literature class engaging, inspiring, and full of meaningful lessons. Your passion for literature and teaching motivated me to appreciate the value of literature and the impact they have on our country and world.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This class has been an unforgettable experience, and I will always carry the lessons I have learned with me.&#x1F496;
